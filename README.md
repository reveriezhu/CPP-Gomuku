# C++_AI_Implemented_Gomuku
AI-Implemented Gomuku | Curriculum Design of Programming
- Designed and implemented a Gomuku chess game supporting PVP and PVE with C++, according to object-oriented programming
- Established the framework of separate graphic user interfaces (GUI) powered by Qt and the implementations of the game
- Constructed the Gomuku AI based on a game tree, the min-max algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning algorithm
- Realized the breakpoint savings at any point and re-demonstration of each step of the saved games
- Promoted the robustness by testing the AI on the white box, and the GUI on the black box
